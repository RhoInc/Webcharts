# Webcharts
A charting library built on top of <a href="https://github.com/mbostock/d3">D3.js</a> that offers a simple way to instantiate basic interactive chart with JavaScript. Bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and timelines can be customized with a handful of settings and extended through callback functions. Controls can be specified for filtering chart data or manipulating the settings to change how the chart behaves.
